Rack::Accept
============

Rack::Accept is a suite of tools for Ruby/Rack applications that eases the
complexity of reading and writing Accept, Accept-Charset, Accept-Encoding, and
Accept-Language HTTP request headers.

Some features of the library are:

    * Strict adherence to RFC 2616, specifically section 14
    * Support for HTTP Accept, Accept-Charset, Accept-Encoding, and
      Accept-Language request headers
    * May be used as Rack middleware or standalone
    * Full test suite covering many edge cases

Installation
------------

Using RubyGems:

    $ sudo gem install rack-accept

From a local copy:

    $ git clone git://github.com/mjijackson/rack-accept.git
    $ sudo rake install

Usage
-----

Rack::Accept implements the Rack middleware interface and may be used with any
Rack-based application. Simply insert the Rack::Accept module in your Rack
middleware pipeline and access the Rack::Accept::Request object in the
"rack-accept.request" environment key, as in the following example:

    require 'rack/accept'

    use Rack::Accept

    app = lambda {|env|
        accept = env['rack-accept.request']
        response = Rack::Response.new

        if accept.media_type?('text/html')
            response['Content-Type'] = 'text/html'
            response.write "<p>Hello. You accept text/html!</p>"
        else
            response['Content-Type'] = 'text/plain'
            response.write "Apparently you don't accept text/html. Too bad."
        end

        response.finish
    }

    run app
